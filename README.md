This Solidity file, Module_One_Assessment.sol, demonstrates the use of require, assert, and revert for error handling in Solidity contracts. It includes a simple contract named errorDemo with functions for minting tokens and transferring tokens between addresses.

Getting Started
Compilation and Deployment
Head over to https://remix.ethereum.org/
Upload the file on to the editor.
Press Ctrl/Command + S to compile the file.
Then deploy the contract from the deployment section of the remix platform. The section is present just below the compilation section.
Now, You will be able to interact with the contract "errorDemo".

Require()
